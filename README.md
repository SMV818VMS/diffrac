## Goal

Diffraction includes several function to work and perform differential analysis over pile ups coming from non fractionated RNASeq analysis.

At the moment, we have the following functions:

 - [*_create_toyset_*](#create_toyset) : generates a set of annotation, fasta genome and expression file with known features
 - [*_finddrops_*](#finddrops) : detect drops in the expression profile
 - [*_findmotifs_*](#findmotifs) : clustering of drops and search of common motifs between groups by MEME

Additionally we have some scripts to perform basic computations: _utils.py_ for general problems and _seq\_utils.py_ for specific Sequencing problems.

## create\_toyset

Very basic script to generate a toy set of annotation, expression and fasta genome with known features.

## finddrops

This script looks for drops in the expression using the following algorithm:

1. _finddrops_ accepts a two columns files ([position, expression])
2. It takes the expression profile and an annotation file to compute the average distance between annotations.
3. It works with sliding windows composed by a expression window (100 by default) and a no\_exp\_window (average distance between annotations/4)
4. The drop will only be considered if:
  - Window of expression does not include any 0.0 and the last nucleotide is greater than 0.0
  - Window of no expression has an average smaller than a threshold of expression (0.0 by default)
5. The outcome is a dictionary including: \{identifier:\[window start, window end, last position with expression, stdsc, maxsc, dropsc\]\}
  - As you can notice we see three different scores: stdsc, maxsc and dropsc:
    - stdsc is the standard deviation of the expression window
    - maxsc is the maximum difference between contiguous positions
    - dropsc is the first derivative between the last position and the first nucleotide in the no expression window
  - Additionally we have two positional values:
    - decay start represents the decay start that marks the first nucleotide after which the expression profiles starts to decay with the factor
    - last position with expression

The interpretation for this values is:

  - high stdsc, low maxsc and maxsc != dropsc ==> decay position: The change in expression decays gradually but with no big changes, this hardens the match between maximum change (minimum derivative) and the drop in the last position with expression
  - low stdsc, high maxsc and maxsc == dropsc ==> sharp position: The change in expression is abrupt and with a big difference, this makes easier the match between minimum derivative and the index position.

Additionally, if the termination is sharp, the decay start will match the last expression base, thing that will not occur if the termination is in decay.

The goal is to have a simple rule to discriminate between:

**Decay drop**
![decay drop](figures/decay)

**Sharp drop**
![sharp drop](figures/sharp)

The example of two toy examples:

**Decay drop**

It returns the following figure:

![decay toy](figures/decaytoy.png)

And this result in the dictionary:

  > 'SIGN7': [6936, 7211, 7001, 7087, 42.7662817274757, -71.0, -4.6440034020500001]

**Sharp drop**

![sharp toy](figures/sharptoy.png)

And this result in the dictionary:

  > 'SIGN8': [7849, 8124, 7998, 8000, 29.395014138295107, -179.0, -179.0]

## findmotifs

Script that performs basic clustering methods to define groups in the result provide by [*_finddrops_*](#finddrops) and runs a MEME motif search in the sequences provided.

This script basically takes the output from finddrops, it subsets the signas by clustering and extract them from the genome and looks for motifs in them using MEME suite. The program requires MEME installed and several pregenerated directories to create the output.

At the end, we obtain (at maximum) 5 most represented motifs in the subsequences and xml and html reports generated by MEME ([example](./meme_results/sharp_signals)).

In our toy model, we detect the following motifs:

**Decay drop**

The expected motif here was GATAGATAGATAGATA

**Sharp drop**

The expected motif here was a basic intrinsic terminator
